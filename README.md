# Semester project 2 - Auctionhouse

![image](/images/portfolioauctionhouse.jpg)

I have made a website for an autcion site called Auctionhouse.

## Description

Auctionhouse is an auction website where users can put up items to be bid on and bid on other items that has been put up for auction.

Every new user that registers on the website, gets 1000 credits to use on the site. They will get credits by selling and use credits by buying. Users that are not registered can look at and search through the listings, but you have to be registered to be able to make bids and put out items yourself.
